/**
 * Given a grid with each cell consisting of positive, negative or no points
 * i.e, zero points. We can move across a cell only if we have positive points (
 * > 0 ). Whenever we pass through a cell, points in that cell are added to our
 * overall points. We need to find minimum initial points to reach cell (m-1,
 * n-1) from (0, 0).
 * 
 * Constraints :
 * 
 * From a cell (i, j) we can move to (i+1, j) or (i, j+1). We cannot move from
 * (i, j) if your overall points at (i, j) is <= 0. We have to reach at (n-1,
 * m-1) with minimum positive points i.e., > 0.

	 * To begin with, we should maintain a 2D array dp of the same size as the
	 * grid, where dp[i][j] represents the minimum points that guarantees the
	 * continuation of the journey to destination before entering the cell (i,
	 * j). It�s but obvious that dp[0][0] is our final solution. Hence, for this
	 * problem, we need to fill the table from the bottom right corner to left
	 * top. Now, let us decide minimum points needed to leave cell (i, j)
	 * (remember we are moving from bottom to up). There are only two paths to
	 * choose: (i+1, j) and (i, j+1). Of course we will choose the cell that the
	 * player can finish the rest of his journey with a smaller initial points.
	 * Therefore we have: min_Points_on_exit = min(dp[i+1][j], dp[i][j+1])
